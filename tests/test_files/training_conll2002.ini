[CRF]
### sklearn_crfsuite estimator parameters

# "For more information about these parameters, see the
# CRF class in sklearn_crfsuite/estimator.py"

# Max number of iterations.
ITERATIONS : 100
# CRF training algorithm.
ALGORITHM : lbfgs
# Cut-off threshold for occurrence frequency of a feature.
MIN_FREQ : 0

# Verbose training output - currently has to be set to False,
# because the sklearn-crfsuite module at the time of writing
# cannot do generators (for memory-saving) and verbose mode,
# see more here:
#   https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/sklearn-crfsuite/issues/4
VERBOSE : False

# Hyperparameter optimization using RandomizedSearchCV
# WARNING: Hyperparameter optimization does not work
# with generators... The training data and its features
# are loaded into memory and can get pretty big.
OPTIMIZE : True

# Number of parameter settings that are sampled in case optimization
# is enabled. Trades off runtime vs quality of the solution.
N_ITER : 10

# Number of jobs to run in parallel in case optimization is enabled.
# Keep in mind every parallel job subprocess keeps the training data
# and features in its own memory.
